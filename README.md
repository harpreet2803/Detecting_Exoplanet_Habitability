# Detecting_Exoplanet_Habitability

I analyzed Kepler flux time-series data using LightKurve to detect exoplanets, integrating and cleaning datasets from NASA and Arecibo to create a high-quality dataset with significant class imbalance. I applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and implemented machine learning models, achieving 98% accuracy with KNN and ADASYN oversampling. This work demonstrates my ability to handle large, imbalanced astrophysical datasets, perform advanced feature engineering, and extract actionable scientific insights.
